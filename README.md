# CA3 - Diffusion Models and Score-based Generative Models

This folder contains an educational project for the "Deep Generative Models" course. The code implements two cutting-edge approaches to generative modeling:

- **Diffusion Models**: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for high-quality image generation.
- **Score-based Generative Models**: Learning the score function (gradient of log-density) for sampling from complex distributions using Langevin dynamics.

This README documents the notebook structure, configuration, how to run experiments (without running code here), reproducibility notes, and troubleshooting tips.

## Repository layout

## How to run (local environment instructions)

1. Ensure you have the environment set up as described in the main project README (venv/conda with PyTorch, torchvision, etc.).

2. For Diffusion Models:

   - Download the Sprites dataset (automatically handled in notebook).
   - Review hyperparameters: `timesteps=1000`, `n_feat=64`, `batch_size=100`, `n_epoch=40`.
   - Run training cells to train the U-Net on diffusion.
   - Generate samples using DDPM or DDIM sampling.
   - Evaluate with FID scores.

3. For Score-based Models:
   - The notebook uses synthetic data, so no external downloads needed.
   - Train score networks with fixed or varying sigma.
   - Visualize score fields and sampling trajectories.
   - Compare different sampling methods.

## Reproducibility Notes

- Set random seeds at the beginning of each notebook for reproducible results.
- The diffusion models use a fixed noise schedule; FID evaluation requires consistent real/fake image preprocessing.
- Score-based models work on 2D synthetic data, making them fast to train and easy to visualize.

## Dependencies

- PyTorch, torchvision
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- tqdm, pytorch-fid
- For diffusion: Custom U-Net implementation
- For score-based: MLP with noise conditioning

## Key Concepts Covered

### Diffusion Models

- Forward process: Progressive noise addition
- Reverse process: Learned denoising
- DDPM vs DDIM: Trade-offs between quality and speed
- Conditional generation with context embeddings

### Score-based Models

- Score matching objective
- Noise-conditioned score prediction
- Langevin dynamics for sampling
- Annealed sampling for improved results

## Expected Results

- **Diffusion Models**: High-quality 16x16 sprite images, FID scores improving over training epochs.
- **Score-based Models**: Accurate score field learning, effective sampling from 2D Gaussian mixtures.

## Troubleshooting

- **CUDA Memory**: Reduce batch_size or image size for diffusion models.
- **FID Errors**: Ensure pytorch-fid is installed and images are properly normalized.
- **Slow Training**: Diffusion models are computationally intensive; consider smaller timesteps for experimentation.
